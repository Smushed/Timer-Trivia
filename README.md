## Description

This is a trivia game where you go through 5 questions about various animals. You have 15 seconds to answer the question and 10 seconds inbetween questions.

You select each answer by clicking within the box surrounding the answer. If you select an answer or the timer runs out the screen will shift to the result screen. On the result screen the answer will display along with a picture of the correct animal.

After all 5 questions have been answered or the time ran out, the final result screen will display and all the answers will show on screen. From there you have to restart the page to play the game again.

The biggest thing I would like to improve with this game is the CSS. I'm not fully happy with the way it looks but I feel I wouldn't be putting my time to the best use if I kept trying to style the website. I would rather try and learn more with the next topics in the course.
